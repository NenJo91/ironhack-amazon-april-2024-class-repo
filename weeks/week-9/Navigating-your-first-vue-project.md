# Overview of a VITE + Vue.js Project Structure

When you create a new project using VITE and Vue.js, you will see a variety of files and folders in the project directory. This document provides an overview of the most important documents and folders to help you understand their purposes.

## Top-Level Files and Folders

### `package.json`

This file contains metadata about your project and is crucial for managing dependencies. It includes details such as the project name, version, scripts, and dependencies.

**Key Sections:**

- **`name`**: The name of your project.
- **`version`**: The current version of your project.
- **`scripts`**: Commands that can be run to manage your project (e.g., `dev`, `build`).
- **`dependencies`**: Libraries and frameworks required by your project.
- **`devDependencies`**: Tools and libraries needed for development but not in production.

### `vite.config.js`

This is the configuration file for VITE. It allows you to customize the VITE build process and development server.

### `node_modules`

This folder contains all the dependencies listed in `package.json`. It's managed by npm or yarn and should not be edited manually.

**DO NOT TOUCH!**

### `public`

This folder contains static assets that are served directly without processing. It usually includes files like `index.html` and any static images or icons.

## `src` Folder

The `src` folder is where most of your development work will happen. It contains the source code for your Vue application.

### Navigating the contents of the `src` folder

#### `main.js`

This is the entry point of your application. It creates a new Vue instance and mounts it to a DOM element. Typically, it looks like this:

```javascript
import { createApp } from "vue";
import "./style.css";
import App from "./App.vue";

createApp(App).mount("#app");
```

### `App.vue`

This is the root component of your application. All other components will be nested inside this one. It usually contains the main layout and structure of your app.

Basic Structure:

```javascript
<script setup>
import HelloWorld from './components/HelloWorld.vue'
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <a href="https://vitejs.dev" target="_blank">
      <img src="/vite.svg" class="logo" alt="Vite logo" />
    </a>
    <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">
      <img src="./assets/vue.svg" class="logo vue" alt="Vue logo" />
    </a>
  </div>
  <HelloWorld msg="Vite + Vue" />
</template>

<style scoped>
.logo {
  height: 6em;
  padding: 1.5em;
  will-change: filter;
  transition: filter 300ms;
}
.logo:hover {
  filter: drop-shadow(0 0 2em #646cffaa);
}
.logo.vue:hover {
  filter: drop-shadow(0 0 2em #42b883aa);
}
</style>
```

### `components` Folder

This folder is where you store your Vue components. Components are reusable pieces of the UI that can be used across different parts of your application.

Example:

plaintext

Copy code

`src/
|-- components/
    |-- HelloWorld.vue`

### `assets` Folder

This folder is for your project's static assets such as images, fonts, or any other files that need to be processed by the build tool.

## Common Additional Files

### `README.md`

This is the main documentation file for your project. It typically includes an overview of the project, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.

### `.gitignore`

This file specifies which files and folders should be ignored by Git. Common entries include `node_modules`, `dist`, and environment files.

### `dist`

This folder is generated when you build your project for production. It contains the compiled code that can be deployed to a web server.

## Summary

- `package.json`: Manages project metadata and dependencies.
- `vite.config.js`: Configures VITE.
- `node_modules`: Contains installed dependencies.
- `public`: Contains static assets.
- `src`: Contains the source code for your application.
  - `main.js`: Entry point of the app.
  - `App.vue`: Root component.
  - `components`: Folder for Vue components.
  - `assets`: Folder for static assets.
- `README.md`: Main documentation.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files to be ignored by Git.
- `dist`: Folder for production build output.

Understanding the purpose of these files and folders will help you navigate and manage your Vue.js project effectively. Happy coding!### `App.vue`
