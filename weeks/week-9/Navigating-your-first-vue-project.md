# Overview of a VITE + Vue.js Project Structure

When you create a new project using VITE and Vue.js, you will see a variety of files and folders in the project directory. This document provides an overview of the most important documents and folders to help you understand their purposes.

## Top-Level Files and Folders

### `package.json`

This file contains metadata about your project and is crucial for managing dependencies. It includes details such as the project name, version, scripts, and dependencies.

**Key Sections:**

- **`name`**: The name of your project.
- **`version`**: The current version of your project.
- **`scripts`**: Commands that can be run to manage your project (e.g., `dev`, `build`).
- **`dependencies`**: Libraries and frameworks required by your project.
- **`devDependencies`**: Tools and libraries needed for development but not in production.

### `vite.config.js`

This is the configuration file for VITE. It allows you to customize the VITE build process and development server.

### `node_modules`

This folder contains all the dependencies listed in `package.json`. It's managed by npm or yarn and should not be edited manually.

### `public`

This folder contains static assets that are served directly without processing. It usually includes files like `index.html` and any static images or icons.

## `src` Folder

The `src` folder is where most of your development work will happen. It contains the source code for your Vue application.

### `main.js`

This is the entry point of your application. It creates a new Vue instance and mounts it to a DOM element. Typically, it looks like this:

```javascript
import { createApp } from "vue";
import App from "./App.vue";

createApp(App).mount("#app");
```
