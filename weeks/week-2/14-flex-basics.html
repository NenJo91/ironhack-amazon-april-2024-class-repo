      <h1>Flexbox</h1>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        The Flexbox Layout module aims to provide a more efficient way to
        design, align, and distribute space among the items in a container, even
        when their size is unknown and/or dynamic (hence the word "flex").
      </p>
      <p>
        The main idea behind flexible layout is to give the container the
        ability to alter the width/height of its items (and their order) to best
        fill the available space (especially to adapt to various display devices
        and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free
        space or shrinks them to prevent overflow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most importantly, flexbox layout is direction-agnostic, unlike normal
        layouts (block, which is based on vertical flow, and inline, which is
        based on horizontal flow). While these work well for pages, they lack
        flexibility to support large or complex applications (especially when it
        comes to changing orientation, resizing, stretching, shrinking, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: Flexbox layout is more appropriate for components within an
        application and small-scale layouts, whereas Grid layout is intended for
        larger-scale layouts.
      </p>
      <h2>Basics and Terminology</h2>
      <p>
        Since flexbox is a complete module and not a single property, it entails
        a lot of things, including its whole set of properties. Some are meant
        to be set on the container (parent element, known as "flex container")
        while others are meant to be set on the children (called "flex items").
      </p>
      <p>
        If "normal" layout is based on block and inline flow directions,
        flexible layout is based on "flex flow directions". Refer to this figure
        from the specification, explaining the main idea of flexible layout.

      <p>
        Items are laid out following either the main axis (from start to end) or
        the cross axis (from start to end).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Main Axis</p>
          <p>
            The main axis of a flex container is the primary axis along which
            flex items are laid out. Careful, it's not necessarily horizontal;
            it depends on the flex-direction property (see below).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Main Start - Main End</p>
          <p>
            Flex items are placed within the container starting from main-start
            and going to main-end.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Main Size</p>
          <p>
            The width or height of a flex item, whichever is in the main
            dimension, is the main size of the item. The main size property of a
            flex item is the "width" or "height" property, whichever is in the
            main dimension.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Cross Axis</p>
          <p>
            The axis perpendicular to the main axis is called the cross axis.
            Its direction depends on the direction of the main axis.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Cross Start - Cross End</p>
          <p>
            Flex lines are filled with items and placed in the container
            starting from the cross start side of the flex container and going
            toward the cross end side.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Cross Size</p>
          <p>
            The width or height of a flex item, whichever is in the cross
            dimension, is the cross size of the item. The cross size property is
            the one in the cross dimension of 'width' or 'height'.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Properties for the Parent Element - (flex container)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>display</p>
          <p>
            Defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the given
            value. It enables a flex context for all its direct children.
          </p>
          <p>Note that CSS columns have no effect on a flex container.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>flex-direction</p>
          <p>
            This establishes the main axis, defining thus the direction flex
            items are placed in the flex container. Flexbox is (aside from
            optional wrapping) a single-direction concept. Think of flex items
            as primarily laid out in horizontal rows or vertical columns.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>flex-wrap</p>
          <p>
            By default, flex items will try to fit onto one line. You can change
            this and allow the items to wrap as needed with this property.
          </p>
          <p>Properties</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>nowrap(default)</p>
              <p>all flex items will be on one line</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>wrap</p>
              <p>
                flex items will wrap onto multiple lines, from top to bottom.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>wrap-reverse</p>
              <p>
                Flex items will wrap onto multiple lines from bottom to top.

        <li>
          <p>flex-flow</p>
          <p>
            This is a shorthand for the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties,
            which together define the flex container's main and cross axes. The
            default value is row nowrap.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>justify-content</p>
          <p>
            Defines alignment along the main axis. It helps distribute the
            remaining free space when all the flex items on a line are
            inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size. It
            also exerts some control over the alignment of items when they
            overflow the line.

              <p>
                items pack toward the left edge of the container, unless that
                doesn't make sense with the flex direction, then it behaves like
                start.

            <li>
              <p>space-between</p>
              <p>
                items are evenly distributed in the line; the first item is on
                the start line, the last on the end line
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>space-around</p>
              <p>
                items are evenly distributed in the line with equal space around
                them. Note visually that spaces aren't equal, as all items have
                the same space on both sides. The first item will have one unit
                of space against the container edge, but two units of space
                between the next item because that next item has its own space
                that applies.

            <li>
              <p>space-evenly</p>
              <p>
                Items are distributed so that the space between any two items
                (and the space to the edges) is equal.

        <li>
          <p>align-items</p>
          <p>
            Defines the default behavior for how flex items are laid out along
            the cross axis on the current line. Think of it as align-content for
            the cross axis (perpendicular to the main axis).

            <li>

              <p>
                stretch to fill the container (still respects
                min-width/max-width)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>flex-start / start / self-start</p>
              <p>
                items are placed at the start of the cross axis. The difference
                between these is subtle, and has to do with respecting flex
                direction rules or writing-mode rules.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>flex-end / end / self-end</p>
              <p>
                Items are placed at the end of the cross axis. The difference,
                again, is subtle and has to do with respecting flex direction
                rules or writing-mode rules.
              </p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>align-content</p>
          <p>
            This aligns the lines within a flex container when there is extra
            space in the cross axis, similar to how justify-content aligns
            individual items within the main axis.

            <li>
              <p>flex-start / start</p>
              <p>
                Lines are packed at the start of the container. The (most
                supported) flex-start honors the flex direction while start
                honors the writing-mode direction.

                lines packed at the end of the container. The (most supported)
                flex-end honors the flex direction while end honors the
                writing-mode direction.

          <p>gap, row-gap, column-gap</p>
          <p>
            The gap property explicitly controls the space between flex items.
            It applies that space only between items, not on the outer edges.
            It's not exclusively for flexbox, gap works in grid and multi-column
            layout too.

          <p>order</p>
          <p>
            By default, flex items present in the order of source. However, the

        <li>
          <p>flex-grow</p>
          <p>
            Defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. It accepts
            a unitless value that serves as a proportion. It determines the
            amount of available space inside the flex container that the item
            should take up. If all items have flex-grow set to 1, the remaining
            space in the container will be distributed equally among them. If
            one of the children has a value of 2, that child will take up twice
            the available space of the others (or at least attempt to). Default
            (0), negative numbers invalid.

        <li>
          <p>flex-shrink</p>
          <p>
            Defines the ability for a flex item to shrink if necessary. Default
            (0), negative numbers invalid.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>flex-basis</p>
          <p>
            Defines the default size of an element before distributing the
            remaining space. It can be a length (e.g., 20%, 5rem, etc.) or a
            keyword. The keyword auto means "look at my width or height
            property" (which was momentarily the main-size keyword until it was
            deprecated). The content keyword means "size based on the element's
            content" — this keyword isn't well-supported yet, so it's hard to
            test and harder to know what its siblings max-content, min-content,
            and fit-content do.
          </p>
          <p>
            If set to 0, the extra space around the content isn't taken into
            account. If set to auto, the extra space is distributed based on its
            flex-grow value.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>flex</p>
          <p>
            This is shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis
            combined. The second and third parameters (flex-shrink and
            flex-basis) are optional. The default is 0 1 auto, but if you set it
            with a single numeric value, like flex: 5;, that changes the
            flex-basis to 0%, so it's like setting flex-grow: 5; flex-shrink: 1;
            flex-basis: 0%;.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's recommended to use this shorthand property rather than setting
            the individual properties. The shorthand sets the other values
            intelligently.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>align-self</p>
          <p>
            This allows the default alignment (or the one specified by
            align-items) to be overridden for individual flex items. Refer to
            the align-items explanation to understand the available values.
