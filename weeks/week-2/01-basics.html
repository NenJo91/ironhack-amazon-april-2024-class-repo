    <!-- Adding a style tag to the head of the document -->
    <!-- Internal CSS Approach 
     This approach is a huge no-no! 
     why ? 
    Because as more CSS properties are added, the file increases in size and its hard to read, hard to scale and hard to share -->
    <style>
      h1 {
        color: red;
      }
    </style>
    <!-- Linking an eternal document with css properties  -->
    <!-- rel = relationship -->
    <!-- href= hyperTextReference  -->
    <!-- ALWAYS GO FOR THIS APPROACH -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css" />
