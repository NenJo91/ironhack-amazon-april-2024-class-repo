      <h1>Grid</h1>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system based on grids that,
        compared to any past web layout system, completely changes the way we
        design user interfaces. CSS has always been used to layout our web
        pages, but it has never done a good job. First, we used tables, then
        floats, positioning, and inline-block, but all these methods were
        essentially hacks and left out a lot of important functionality
        (vertical centering, for example). Flexbox is also a great layout tool,
        but its one-dimensional flow has different use cases - and they actually
        work great together! Grid is the first CSS module created specifically
        to solve the layout problems we've all been hacking around while making
        websites all this time.

      <h2>
        Before diving into code, it's important to understand the terminology.
        Since the terms involved in this case are somewhat similar from a
        conceptual standpoint, it's easy to confuse them if their meanings
        defined by the Grid specification aren't memorized first. But don't
        worry, there aren't many.
      </h2>

      <div id="terminology">
        <!-- Grid Container -->
        <div>
          <h2>Grid Container</h2>
          <p>
            The element on which display: grid is applied. It's the direct
            parent of all grid items. In this example, the container is the grid
            container.
          </p>
          <div class="container">
            <div class="item"></div>
            <div class="item"></div>
            <div class="item"></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <!-- Grid Item -->
        <div>
          <h2>Grid Item</h2>
          <p>
            The children (direct descendants) of the grid container. In this
            case, the grid elements are part of it, but sub-elements are not.
          </p>
          <div class="container">
            <div class="item"></div>
            <div class="item">
              <p class="sub-item"></p>
            </div>
            <div class="item"></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <!-- Grid Line -->
        <div>
          <h2>Grid Line</h2>
          <p>
            These are the dividing lines that make up the grid structure. They
            can be vertical ("column grid lines") or horizontal ("row grid
            lines") and reside on both sides of a row or column. In this case,
            the yellow line is an example of a column grid line.

        <!-- Grid Cell -->
        <div>
          <h2>Grid Cell</h2>
          <p>
            The space between two adjacent row grid lines and two adjacent
            column grid lines. It's a single "unit" of the grid. Here's the grid
            cell between row grid lines 1 and 2, and column grid lines 2 and 3.

        <!-- Grid Track -->
        <div>
          <h2>Grid Track</h2>
          <p>
            The space between two adjacent grid lines. You can think of them as
            the columns or rows of the grid. Here's the grid track between the
            second and third row grid lines.
          </p>

        <!-- Grid Area -->
        <div>
          <h2>Grid Area</h2>
          <p>
            The total space surrounded by four grid lines. A grid area can be
            composed of any number of grid cells. Here's the grid area between
            row grid lines 1 and 3, and column grid lines 1 and 3.

            <p>
              Defines the columns and rows of the grid with a space-separated
              list of values. The values represent the track size, and the space
              between them represents the grid line.

                <p>Track size</p>
                <p>
                  Can be a length, a percentage, or a fraction of the free space
                  of the grid using the fr unit. <br />
                  (fr = fraction.)

              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Line name</p>

            <div class="container-example-fractions-2"></div>
            <!-- container-example-simple-grid -->
            <p>
              Grid lines are automatically assigned positive numbers from these
              assignments (with -1 being an alternative for the last row). Let's
              look at the CSS example with the class
              container-example-simple-grid.
            </p>
            <!-- container-example-image -->
            <p>
              But you can choose to explicitly name the lines. Note the bracket
              syntax for line names. Let's look at the CSS example with the
              class container-example-image.
            </p>
            <!-- container-example-more-than-one-name -->
            <p>
              Note that a line can have more than one name. For example, here
              the second line will have two names: row1-end and row2-start.
              Let's look at the CSS example with the class
              container-example-more-than-one-name.
            </p>
            <!-- container-example-repeat-notation -->
            <p>
              If your definition contains parts that repeat, you can use the
              repeat() notation to streamline things. Let's look at the CSS
              example with the class container-example-repeat-notation.
            </p>
            <!-- container-example-without-repeat-notation -->
            <p>
              This example with the class container-example-repeat-notation is
              equivalent to the example with the class
              container-example-without-repeat-notation.
            </p>
            <!-- container-example-fractions -->
            <p>
              The fr unit allows you to set the size of a track as a fraction of
              the free space of the grid container. For example
              (container-example-fractions), this will set each item to
              one-third of the width of the grid container. Let's look at the
              CSS example with the class container-example-fractions.
            </p>
            <!-- container-example-fractions-2 -->
            <p>
              Free space is calculated after any non-flexible items. In this
              example, the total amount of free space available for fr units
              doesn't include the 50px.
            </p>
          </li>
          <!-- grid-template-areas -->
          <li>
            <p>grid-template-areas</p>
            <p>
              Defines a grid template by referencing grid area names specified
              with the grid-area property. Repeating the name of a grid area
              causes the content to span those cells. A period signifies an
              empty cell. The syntax itself provides a visualization of the grid
              structure.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <p>Values</p>
              <li>
                <p>Grid area name</p>
                <p>Name of a grid area specified with grid-area</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>None</p>
                <p>No grid areas defined</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <!-- UNCOMMENT TO SHOW CODE EXAMPLES FROM BELOW -->
            <div class="container-example-grid-template-areas">
              <div class="item-a"></div>
              <div class="item-b"></div>
              <div class="item-c"></div>
              <div class="item-d"></div>
            </div>
            <!-- container-example-grid-template-areas  -->
            <p>
              This example with the class container-example-grid-template-areas
              will create a grid four columns wide by three rows high. The
              entire top row will be composed of the header area. The middle row
              will consist of two main areas and a sidebar area. The last row is
              the entire footer area.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each row in your declaration must have the same number of cells.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can use any number of adjacent periods to declare a single
              empty cell. As long as the periods don't have spaces between them,
              they represent a single cell.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note that you're not naming lines with this syntax, only areas.
              When using this syntax, the lines at the edges of the areas are
              automatically named. If your grid area name is foo, the name of
              the starting row line and starting column line of the area will be
              foo-start, and the name of its ending row line and ending column
              line will be foo-end. This means that some lines may have multiple
              names, like the leftmost edge line in the previous example, which
              will have three names: header-start, main-start, and footer-start.
            </p>
          </li>
          <!-- grid-template -->
          <li>
            <p>grid-template</p>
            <p>
              A way to abbreviate setting the grid template rows
              (grid-template-rows), grid template columns
              (grid-template-columns), and grid template areas
              (grid-template-area) of the grid in a single declaration.

                <p>grid-template-rows / grid-template-columns</p>

                  Sets the specified values of grid-template-columns and
