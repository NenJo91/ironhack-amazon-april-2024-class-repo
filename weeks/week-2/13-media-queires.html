      CSS Media queries are a way to target the browser based on certain
      characteristics, traits, and preferences of the user, and then apply
      styles or execute other code based on those things. Perhaps the most
      common media queries in the world are those that target particular ranges
      of the viewport and apply custom styles, which gave rise to the idea of
      responsive design.

    <p><strong>Do you really need CSS Media queries?</strong></p>
    <p>
      Media queries are a powerful tool in your CSS toolbox with exciting hidden
      gems. But if you accommodate your design to every possible situation
      you'll end up with a codebase too complex to maintain and, as we all know,
      CSS is like a bear cub: cute and harmless, but when it grows up it will
      eat you alive.

      There's a quite interesting book called
      <strong>Accessibility for Everyone by <i>Laura Kalbag</i></strong> that
      summarizes accessibility in a cute analogy.
    </p>
    <p>
      An accessible designer would create a big door for wheelchair users to
      enter, while a universal designer would produce an entrance that anyone
      could fit through regardless of their abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know talking about universal design on the web is difficult and almost
      sounds utopian, but think about it, there are around 150 different
      browsers, around 50 different combinations of user preferences, this means
      there are at least 18 million possible cases in which your content can be
      displayed.
