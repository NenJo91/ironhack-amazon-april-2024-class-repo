// Directives in Vue are special instructions used to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) and apply specific behaviors to elements in a Vue application. They are special attributes added to HTML tags that begin with the prefix "v-".

// There are different types of directives in Vue, such as:

// v-if: Allows you to render or not render an HTML element based on a conditional expression. If the expression is true, the element will be displayed; otherwise, it will be hidden.

// v-for: Allows you to iterate over a list of elements and generate dynamic content. You can use it to display a list of elements in the DOM.

// v-bind: Used to bind HTML attributes to dynamic values in the Vue component. For example, you can bind the "src" attribute of an "img" tag to a component property.

// v-on: Allows you to listen to events in the DOM and execute methods in response to those events. For example, you can use v-on to execute a function when a button is clicked.

// v-model: Provides two-way binding between a data property and a form element. It is useful for handling user input in forms.

// These directives are used to extend the functionality of Vue and allow the creation of interactive and dynamic applications. By using directives, we can control the behavior and appearance of HTML elements declaratively, making it easier to manipulate and update the DOM in response to changes in data or application events.
