 What is the Fetch API?
 The Fetch API is a modern JavaScript interface that allows you to make HTTP requests to servers.
 It provides a simpler and more powerful alternative to XMLHttpRequest (XHR) for fetching resources asynchronously from a server.


 Why Use the Fetch API?
 - Simplicity: The Fetch API provides a simpler and more intuitive way to make HTTP requests compared to XHR(outdated way), with a more modern syntax.
 - Promises-Based: It is built on top of promises, making it easier to handle asynchronous operations and chaining multiple requests.
 - Streamlined Code: Fetch simplifies the process of making requests and handling responses, resulting in cleaner and more readable code.
 - Built-in Browser Support: Fetch is supported natively in most modern browsers, reducing the need for polyfills or external libraries.
